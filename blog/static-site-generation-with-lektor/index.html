  <p>Static sites provide many advantages over dynamic websites. For instance a blog is meant to be read more often than it's written/generated, lot of processing is performed with every page request in a CMS such as Wordpress. I have been looking for a solution which would provide a simple and extensible CMS which would also generate static pages. While Jekyll is great, having a CMS is more convenient.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a> recently and it works great for this purpose. One can use the admin page to add or modify pages and publish. Publishing is done with one click. It generates the static files and deploys using travis-CI.</p>

<p>I hope to use this site to regularly work about things I find interesting. I hope to see you around!</p>
