  <p>Static sites provide many advantages over dynamic websites. For instance a blog is meant to be read more often than it's written/generated, lot of processing is performed with every page request in a CMS such as Wordpress. I have been looking for a solution which would provide a simple and extensible CMS which would generate static sites. While Jekyll is great, being able use an Admin pages to write content is desirable.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a> recently and works great for this purpose.
